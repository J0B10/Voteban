# Voteban

**Disclaimer:** _This README and the associated bot is one big sarcastic shitpost.  
No one will ever be banned or kicked by the bot.  
We belive that talking to each other and explaining misbehaviour is better than just voting to ban people.  
For us `/voteban` is just a meme to show disagreement but at the same time laugh all together.  
If you are looking for a real moderation tool this is propably not the right bot.  
Also be aware if using the bot that it sadly has the potential to be misused or misunderstood._
